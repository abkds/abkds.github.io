Hi I am Abhishek. I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Texas A&M University. I am interested in apply deep learning for solving problems in the domain of medical imaging.
I believe advances in medical imaging will definitely benefit the society for greater good. Apart from this I am also interested in recommender systems.
  
I graduated from IIT Roorkee in 2015, after that I worked for Visa Inc for 2 years and 3 months and after that I worked at FlyHomes for 10 months prior to joining A&M.
I am amateur runner, who runs a lot of marathons. I also love anime and manga. Over the years I have only been able to keep up with One Piece.
